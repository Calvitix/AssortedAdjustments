# Assorted Adjustments

[Phoenix Point Mod][Modnix] Various little tweaks to adjust the game to your liking.

## Features

### UI
* Research and Production points are shown in Info-Bar and the Manufacture/Research-Queues. To make a bit more sense of the required times.
* The tooltip at recruitment zones in havens now show the personal abilities of the recruit (Adapted from Sheepy's "Recruit Info").
* The global agenda tracker (or however you call it) now shows travel and exploration times of your aircraft. 
    * The context menu will show expected times behind the action too (Borrowed from Sheepy).

### Gameplay
* Maxed out soldiers now gain additional SP for their wasted XP (Rebuilds Sheepy's "Spill Exp to Skill"). Conversion rate and multiplier is configurable.
* Return Fire has a (configurable) maximum reaction angle and a (configurable) shot limit per turn (Thx pantolomin for the inspiration).
* Squad limit in missions can be configured (Vanilla: 8, Default: 10).
* All missions can be set to always collect any dropped items (Default: off).
* Adjust item drop rate (lower destruction chance) and allow weapons to drop (Thx RealityMachina for the inspiration). All configurable.
* Prepared some soldier attributes to be changed via settings (Default: off).
* Aircraft speeds and space slightly raised. You can configure that too.
* Reduced manufacturing times and resource costs for all items. Raised their scrap values.
* Disable ambushes but retained them if inside the mist (Thx Sheepy).
* Disable the annoying "Right Click Move" in tactical missions. God.
* Disable the rock tiles in bases. 
* Keep the game paused when ordering vehicles to travel and when a squad is rested (Thx Sheepy).



#### Facilities
* Medical bays and vehicle bays have their base healing/repair rate doubled.
* Food production base output slightly raised.
* Fabrication plants generate 1(one) Material per day.
* Research labs generate 1(one) Tech per day.
* Prepared several other values to be changed via settings.
* All values configurable.

### QOL
* Intro logos and introductary movie will get skipped (Sheepy's "Skip Intro" can do even more, if you want to use that, please disable these via settings).

## Settings
Everything is configurable. I tried to be very clear in naming the settings so everything should be more or less self-explanatory.  
In the future i hope i can add a detailed table with the Setting, its default value and an extensive description.

## Notes
Requires Modnix 2.5.3 or higher.  
Tested with GOG Year One Edition (1.9).  
Some features are derivates of existent mods which are adapted, sometimes fixed to work with the YOE version of the game.  
If the original mods work for you and/or you just like them better, please disable the corresponding feature in the settings of this mod.
